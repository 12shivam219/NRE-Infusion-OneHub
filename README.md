## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

\`\`\`bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd nretech-onehub
\`\`\`

### 2. Install Dependencies

\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file:

Update the `.env` file with your Supabase credentials:

\`\`\`env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id (optional)
VITE_APP_URL=http://localhost:5173
\`\`\`

### 4. Database Setup

The database schema and storage buckets have already been created via migrations. All necessary tables, indexes, RLS policies, and storage buckets are configured automatically.

**Tables Created:**
- users
- refresh_tokens
- user_sessions
- login_history
- activity_logs
- documents
- document_versions
- requirements
- interviews
- email_threads
- consultants
- attachments
- notifications
- google_drive_tokens
- error_reports
- rate_limits

**Storage Buckets:**
- documents (for file uploads)

### 5. Create Admin User

After starting the application, register a new account. Then, manually update the user's role in Supabase:

\`\`\`sql
UPDATE users
SET role = 'admin', status = 'approved'
WHERE email = 'your_email@example.com';
\`\`\`

### 6. Run the Development Server

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### 7. Build for Production

\`\`\`bash
npm run build
\`\`\`

### 8. Preview Production Build

\`\`\`bash
npm run preview
\`\`\`
